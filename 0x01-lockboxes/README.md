LOCKBOXES
To determine if all the boxes can be opened, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This algorithm will allow us to explore each box and keep track of which boxes have been visited (i.e., opened). We start from the first box (which is unlocked) and use the keys found inside each box to open other boxes.

Here's how the algorithm can be implemented:

Initialize a set to keep track of visited (opened) boxes.
Initialize a stack to manage the boxes to be processed. Start by pushing the first box (box 0) onto the stack since it is unlocked.
Process the stack until it is empty:
Pop a box from the stack.
Mark this box as visited.
For each key in this box, if the corresponding box has not been visited, add it to the stack for future processing.
Check if the number of visited boxes equals the total number of boxes. If they match, it means all boxes can be opened.
