To solve this problem, we need to calculate the fewest number of operations to obtain exactly n H characters in the file starting with a single 'H'. The operations allowed are "Copy All" and "Paste".

Strategy:
The strategy to minimize the number of operations involves understanding that the problem can be framed in terms of finding the prime factors of n. Each factor represents a sequence of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

Explanation:
Start with one 'H' in the file.
When you copy all and paste, you double the number of H's. This is equivalent to multiplying the current count by 2.
If you paste multiple times after a single copy, it is like multiplying the current count by a certain factor.
Thus, to achieve exactly n H characters, the optimal way is to break down n into its prime factors. Each prime factor contributes to a series of operations:

Copying the current string (which takes one operation)
Pasting the copied string multiple times (each paste is an operation)
For example:

To get 9 H's:
The prime factors of 9 are 3 and 3.
This translates to: Copy (1 operation) + Paste Paste (2 operations for the first 3), then Copy (1 operation) + Paste Paste (2 operations for the next 3) => Total of 6 operations.
